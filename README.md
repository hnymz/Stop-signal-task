Procedure:
1. Generate images using image_generator.py.
2. Run the experiment using piloting_rev.py.

Note. 
1. All images with the same number in the same trial share the same noise background.
2. If you are running the experiment with a limited RAM, it would be better to put the code in a large disk and manually increase virtual memory to avoid memory errors.
3. Need to be careful with EEG triggers in piloting_rev.py.
